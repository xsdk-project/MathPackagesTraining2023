## Introduction to Optimization

Optimization algorithms seek to find the input variables or parameters (referred to as "control", 
"design" or "optimization" variables) that minimize (or maximize) a function of interest.

$$
\underset{p}{\text{minimize}} \quad f(p),
$$

where $$p \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ are the optimization variables and $$f(p): \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is the 
objective function. In this lesson, we focus on gradient-based optimization methods -- methods that utilize information 
about the sensitivity of the objective function with respect to its inputs. 

Solutions to this problem are found where the gradient of the objective function is zero, $$\nabla_p f(p) = 0$$. 
However, this is only a *necessary* but not sufficient condition for optimality given that other stationary points 
(e.g., maxima) also satisfy this condition.

### Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)

To find local minima for the above problems, we replace the original problem with a sequence of quadratic subproblems,

$$
\underset{d}{\text{minimize}} \quad f_k + d^Tg_k + \frac{1}{2}d^TH_kd^T,
$$

where $$g_k = \nabla_p f(p_k)$$ is the gradient, $$H_k = \nabla_p^2 f(p_k)$$ is the Hessian, $$d \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ is 
the search direction, and the $$k$$ subscript denotes evaluation at the iterate $$p_k$$. The exact solution to this 
quadratic subproblem is the inversion of the Hessian onto the negative gradient, $$d = -H_k^{-1} g_k$$. This can also 
be viewed as the application of the Newton root-finding method to the system of nonlinear equations defined by the 
optimality condition $$\nabla_p f(p) = 0$$.

In order to avoid non-minimum stationary points, we also seek to find a step length $$\alpha$$ that approximately 
minimizes the objective function along the line defined by the search direction,

$$
\underset{\alpha}{\text{minimize}} \quad \Phi(\alpha) = f(p_k + \alpha d).
$$

This scalar minimization problem is called a "line search", and is categorized as a "globalization" method because it helps 
maintain consistency between the local quadratic model and the global nonlinear function.

The SQP class of algorithms can be summarized with the pseudocode:

![](sqp_pseudo.png){:width="25%"}

In this approach, different approximations to the search direction solution yield different members of the SQP family:

+ **Truncated Newton:** $$d = -H_k^{-1} g_k$$ with Hessian inverted iteratively (e.g., Krylov methods) using dynamic tolerances
+ **Quasi-Newton:** $$d = -B_k g_k$$ where $$B_k \approx H_k^{-1}$$ with low-rank updates based on the Secant condition
+ **Conjugate Gradient:** $$d_k = -g_k + \beta d_{k-1}$$ with $$\beta$$ defining different CG update formulas
+ **Gradient Descent:** $$d = g_k$$ with Hessian replaced with the identity matrix

Truncated Newton is considered a second-order method because it utilizes full second-order derivative information in 
the solution of the search direction. Meanwhile, Gradient Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods are clear first-order 
methods as they only use the gradient of the objective. The Quasi-Newton method, although technically a first-order 
method, typically exhibits performance closer to Newton's method by utilizing a Secant approximation to estimate 
second-order information.

Oftentimes we are interested in solving optimization problems where the evaluation of the objective function depends on 
the solution of a partial-differential-equation (PDE). These problems are represented in the most general case by

$$
\underset{p, u}{\text{minimize}} \quad f(p, u) \quad \text{subject to} \quad R(p, u) = 0,
$$

where $$u \in \mathbb{R}^m$$ are the state or solution variables for the PDE and 
$$R: \mathbb{R}^{n+m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$$ are the state equations (e.g., discretized PDE residual).

A common and convenient way to recast this problem is to represent the state variables as implicit functions of the 
optimization variables,

$$
\underset{p}{\text{minimize}} \quad f(p, u(p)).
$$

This eliminates the PDE constraint, converting the problem to an unconstrained version that can be solved by many 
popular unconstrained optimization algorithms. This comes at the cost of performing a complete PDE solution for every 
evaluation of the objective function, as well as an adjoint solution to efficiently compute gradients.

For more detail on PDE-constrained optimization, please refer to the 
<a href="https://xsdk-project.github.io/MathPackagesTraining/lessons/boundary_control_tao/">"Boundary Control with 
PETSc/TAO and AMReX" lecture from ATPESC 2019</a>.

### Sensitivity Analysis

Sequential Quadratic Programming is a gradient-based approach -- i.e., it uses information about the sensitivity of the 
objective function output to changes in the input (optimization) parameters to iteratively search for the nearest local 
minimum. In order to use SQP algorithms, the applications must, at minimum, provide first-order derivative information.

In the broadest sense, there are two generalized ways to compute gradients.

**Numerical Differentiation** approximates the derivative of a function using numerical methods. In the current 
lecture, we will evaluate the finite difference (FD) method and specifically use the forward difference formulation 
given by

$$
\frac{df}{dp_i} = \frac{f(p + he_i) + f(p)}{h} + \mathcal{O}(h) \quad \forall \; i = 1, 2, \dots, N,
$$

where $$h$$ is the finite perturbation, $$e_i$$ is the standard basis vector for the $$i^{th}$$ coordinate, and 
$$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ is truncation error for the approximation.

The FD method allows us to compute the gradient for any function easily, using only the function output, without 
requiring information about the function itself. However, computing each element of the gradient requires a separate 
function evaluation, causing the computational cost of the method to scale up rapidly with increasing problem sizes.

Furthermore, the FD method also presents a step size dilemma in choosing the numerical magnitude of the perturbation 
$$h$$. The step size must be chosen sufficiently small to minimize truncation error, but also sufficiently large to 
ensure that subtractive cancellation error does not dominate. Since this cancellation error is problem-dependent, 
the ideal value of $$h$$ differs for each application and may leave the user no choice but to accept the presence of 
a large error in the gradient.

**Analytical Differentiation** computes the exact derivative by generating a stand-alone mathematical or algorithmic 
expression for the gradient.

<img src="analytical_deriv.png" alt="2D Rosenbrock Function" width="50%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

For simpler problems with objective functions that have human-readable closed-form expressions, this approach can be 
thought of as manually differentiating the expression on paper and implementing a dedicated subroutine to evaluate it. 
Although the hands-on example problem below is implemented with this approach, it is not suitable for most real-world 
applications. Practical problems in many scientific disciplines are too complex to be differentiated by hand.

For problems where the objective function depends on a complex subroutine (e.g., the discretized residual for a partial 
differential equation), algorithmic or automatic differentiation (AD) applies the chain rule to the sequence of 
elementary operations performed by the function. This is typically done with an AD tool that transforms the source code 
to generate a new subroutine for the derivative before compile time, or an AD library that overloads the elementary 
operations in the source code at compile time to generate compiled code for the derivative.

This approach produces accurate gradients at a computational cost that is largely insensitive to the size of the 
optimization problem. However, the FD methods remain an easy alternative for rapid prototyping and testing, especially 
when the problem size is small and objective function evaluations are not expensive.

## Using TAO

Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) is a package of optimization algorithms and tools developed at Argonne National 
Laboratory and distributed with the [Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing (PETSc)][4] library. TAO is 
primarily intended for continuous gradient-based optimization and supports PDE-constrained problems using the 
reduced-space formulation.

Below is a TAO main file template that can be adapted to any gradient-based optimization problem:

```c
#include "petsc.h"

typedef struct {
  int n; /* number of optimization variables */
} AppCtx;

PetscErrorCode FormFunction(Tao tao, Vec P, PetscReal *fcn, void *ptr)
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx *user = (AppCtx*)ptr;

  /* Compute the objective function at point P and store in fcn */

  return 0;
}

PetscErrorCode FormGradient(Tao tao, Vec P, Vec G, void *ptr)
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx *user = (AppCtx*)ptr;

  /* Compute the gradient at point P and store in vector G */

  return 0;
}

PetscErrorCode FormHessian(Tao tao, Vec P, Mat H, Mat Hpre, void *ptr)
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx *user = (AppCtx*)ptr;

  /* Compute the Hessian at point P and store in matrix H */
  /* Note: Hpre is an OPTIONAL preconditioner for inverting the Hessian */

  return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx user;
  Tao tao;
  Vec X;
  Mat H;

  /* Initialize the PETSc library */
  ierr = PetscInitialize( &argc, &argv, (char *)0, (char *)0);if (ierr) return ierr;

  /* Create solution vector and Hessian matrix */
  ierr = VecCreate(PETSC_COMM_WORLD, &X);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = VecSetSizes(X, PETSC_DECIDE, user.n);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = VecSet(X, 0.0);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = MatCreate(PETSC_COMM_WORLD, &H);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = MatSetSizes(H, PETSC_DECIDE, PETSC_DECIDE, user.n, user.n);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = MatSetUp(H);CHKERRQ(ierr);

  /* Create Tao solver and configure */
  ierr = TaoCreate(PETSC_COMM_WORLD, &tao);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = TaoSetType(tao, TAOBQNLS);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = TaoSetInitialVector(tao, X);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = TaoSetObjectiveRoutine(tao, FormFunction, &user);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = TaoSetGradientRoutine(tao, FormGradient, &user);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = TaoSetHessianRoutine(tao )
  ierr = TaoSetFromOptions(tao);CHKERRQ(ierr);

  /* Trigger the solution */
  ierr = TaoSolve(tao);CHKERRQ(ierr);

  /* Clean up PETSc objects and finalize */
  ierr = VecDestroy(&X);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = MatDestroy(&H);CHKERQ(ierr);
  ierr = TaoDestroy(&tao);CHKERRQ(ierr);
  ierr = PetscFinalize();

  return 0;
}
```

TAO calls the user-provided ``FormFunction()``, ``FormGradient()`` and ``FormHessian()`` routine whenever the 
optimization algorithm needs to evaluate the objective, its gradient and Hessian. The ``AppCtx`` structure contains 
any data the user has to preserve and propagate through for these computations.

Applications where it is more efficient to evaluate the objective function together with the gradient can use 
an alternative [``TaoSetObjectiveAndGradientRoutine()``][5] interface to provide TAO a single ``FormFunctionGradient()`` 
callback that evaluates both at the same time.

TAO implements several bound-constrained algorithm types that also solve unconstrained problems when there are no 
bounds defined in the problem setup. Algorithm types can be changed either via the `TaoSetType()` interface using the 
solver names given in the first column below, or changed at runtume with the option flag `-tao_type <solver>` using the 
string arguments given in the second column.

|**Solver Type**|**Option Flag**|**Description**|
|[``TAOBNLS``][11]|`bnls`|Bound-constrained Newton Line Search|
|[``TAOBNTR``][12]|`bntr`|Bound-constrained Newton Trust Region|
|[``TAOBQNLS``][13]|`bqnls`|Bound-constrained Quasi-Newton Line Search|
|[``TAOBNCG``][14]|`bncg`|Bound-constrained Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient|

The TAO solution can also be configured with additional runtime flags and corresponding code interfaces shown below.

|**Option Flag**|**Code API**|**Description**|
|`-tao_monitor`|`TaoSetMonitor()` with `TaoMonitorDefault()`|Enable the iteration monitor for the solution|
|`-tao_view`|`TaoView()`|Display useful information about the solution after completion|

|`-tao_max_funcs <integer>`|`TaoSetMaximumFunctionEvaluations()`|Change the maximum number of function evaluations|
|`-tao_gatol <float>`|`TaoSetTolerances()`|Change the absolute convergence tolerance|
|`-tao_test_gradient`|`TaoTestGradient()`|Validate the analytical gradient with finite differences at every iteration|
|`-tao_test_hessian`|`TaoTestHessian()`|Validate the analytical Hessian with finite differences at every iteration|

<summary><h4 style="margin: 0 0 0 0; display: inline">Defining Constraints(Click to expand!)</h4></summary>
The discussion so far has focused exclusively on unconstrained problems even though the TAO solvers listed above are 
all capable of solving bound-constrained problems. Bounds, which are also sometimes called "box" constraints, are 
scalar limits placed on the optimization variables, such that

$$
\begin{align}
  \underset{p}{\text{minimize}} &\quad f(p) \\
  \text{subject to} &\quad p_l \leq p \leq p_u
\end{align}
$$

where $$p_l$$ and $$p_u$$ are the lower and upper bound vectors, respectively. In optimization problems solved with 
TAO, users can set the bounds with the following workflow:

```c
/* Duplicate from solution vector and set bounds */
ierr = VecDuplicate(X, &XL);CHKERRQ(ierr);
ierr = VecSet(XL, PETSC_NINFINITY);CHKERRQ(ierr);
ierr = VecDuplicate(X, &XU);CHKERRQ(ierr);
ierr = VecSet(XU, 0.0);CHKERRQ(ierr);
ierr = TaoSetVariableBounds(tao, XL, XU);CHKERRQ(ierr);
```

In this particular example, the lower bound is set to negative-infinity which designates it as "unbounded", and the 
upper bound is zero, thus forcing the solver to produce zero or negative solutions only. For positive solutions, the 
lower bound would be set to 0 while the upper bound would be set to `PETSC_INFINITY`. Furthermore, the bounds can also 
be adjusted differently for individual optimization variables using `VecSetValue(xl, i, val, INSERT_VALUES)` where `i` 
is the index of the variable and `val` is the boundary value.

In addition to bound-constrained methods, TAO also implements an [Augmented Lagrangian Method of Multipliers (``TAOALMM``)][15] 
for generally constrained optimization problems of the form:

$$
\begin{align}
  \underset{p}{\text{minimize}} &\quad f(p) \\
  \text{subject to} &\quad c_e(p) = 0 \\
                    &\quad c_i(p) \leq 0 \\
                    &\quad p_l \leq p \leq p_u
\end{align}
$$

`TAOALMM` converts this inequality constraints to equality constraints using an [interior-point formulation][16], and then 
converts the equality constrained problem into a sequence of unconstrained or bound-constrained problems using the 
[augmented Lagrangian method][17]. The unconstrained/bound-constrained subproblems are solved by one of the existing 
bound-constrained TAO solvers.

TAO requires equality and inequality constraints to be defined as function callbacks, separately for the constraint 
vector and its Jacobian (matrix of sensitivities).

```c
PetscErrorCode FormEqualityConstraints(Tao tao, Vec P, Vec CE, void* ptr)
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx *user = (AppCtx*)ptr;

  /* Compute the vector of equality constraints CE at solution P */

  return 0;
}

PetscErrorCode FormEqualityJacobian(Tao tao, Vec P, Mat AE, Mat AEpre, void* ptr)
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx *user = (AppCtx*)ptr;

  /* Compute the equality constraint Jacobian matrix AE at solution P */
  /* NOTE: AEpre represents a "pseudoinverse" of AE but is ignored in most applications */

  return 0;
}

PetscErrorCode FormInqualityConstraints(Tao tao, Vec P, Vec CI, void* ptr)
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx *user = (AppCtx*)ptr;

  /* Compute the vector of equality constraints CI at solution P */

  return 0;
}

PetscErrorCode FormEqualityJacobian(Tao tao, Vec P, Mat AI, Mat AIpre, void* ptr)
{
  PetscErrorCode ierr;
  AppCtx *user = (AppCtx*)ptr;

  /* Compute the inequality constraint Jacobian matrix AI at solution P */
  /* NOTE: AIpre represents a "pseudoinverse" of AI but is ignored in most applications */

  return 0;
}

[The Rosenbrock function][1], also called a "banana function", is a canonical nonconvex test problem created by 
Howard H. Rosenbrock in 1960 and used extensively to evaluate the performance of optimization algorithms. The 
original function is defined as

$$
f(p_1, p_2) = (1 - p_1)^2 + 100(p_2 - p_1^2)^2,
$$

with a global minimum at $$(1, 1)$$.

In this lecture, we will be using a multidimensional generalization of this problem is given by

$$
f(p) = f(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left[ (1 - p_i)^2 + 100(p_{i+1} - p_i^2)^2 \right],
$$

with a global minimum at $$p_i = 1$$.

The hands-on example implements the multidimensional Rosenbrock with an analytical gradient and Hessian. However, 
TAO also provides [``TaoDefaultComputeGradient()``][2] and [``TaoDefaultComputeHessian()``][3] callbacks that utilize 
finite-differencing to generate the required sensitivities.

Compile and run the [source code](multidim_rosenbrock.c) as below to solve the default two-dimensional case. If running

In this output, the `Residual` indicates the L2-norm of the gradient, $$\|g_k\|_2$$, at every iteration. The problem 
file is configured to terminate the solution when this gradient norm drops below the absolute tolerance of $$10^{-5}$$. 

The hands-on example can be modified using the following command-line options:

|**Option Flag**|**Description**|
|`-n <integer>`|Change the problem size (default: 2)|
|`-fd`|Use finite-difference gradients instead of analytical|
|`-bound`|Activate bound constraints -- 2-D only (default: $$p_1 \leq 0, \; p_2 \geq 0$$)|
|`-eq`|Activate equality constraints -- 2-D only (default: $$(p_1 - 1)^2 + p_2 - 3 = 0$$)|

## Hands-on Activities

1. Change the TAO algorithm to nonlinear conjugate gradient method using `-tao_type bncg` and to truncated Newton 
using `-tao_type bnls`. Compare convergence against the default quasi-Newton method (`-tao_type bqnls`).

2. Increase the problem size with the `-n <size>` argument (default size is 2) and evaluate its impact on convergence.
  * Repeat Activity 2 with different TAO algorithms. Do they all exhibit the same scaling?  
<br>

3. Solve the problem with the finite difference gradient using the `-fd` argument. Evaluate convergence and solution 
time with increasing problem size.

4. Try running the problem in parallel with `mpiexec -n <# of processes> ./multidim_rosenbrock ...`. Why does running 
in parallel slow the solution down at small problem sizes? How large should the problem be to observe a speedup in 
parallel runs?
  * Repeat Activity 4 with different TAO algorithms. Are the break-even points in size vs. performance the same?  
<br>

5. Run the problem with `-bound` flag to enable $$p_1 \leq 0$$ and $$p_2 \geq 0$$ constraints.
  * Change the starting point and evaluate how it affects the convergence. Is there a difference between starting from 
  the feasible versus non-feasible space?
  * Repeat Activity 5 with different bound-constrained TAO algorithms.

6. Run the problem with `-eq` flag to enable the $$(p_1 - 1)^2 + p_2 = 3$$ constraint.
  * Change the starting point to $$(-1,-1)$$ and evaluate whether you recover the same solution as before. If not, why?
  * Combine equality constraints with bound constraints and try changing the starting point back to $$(10,10)$$. Which 
  solution did you converge to?

7. ADVANCED: Change the constraint definition. Come up with constraints that are valid for the multidimensional 
Rosenbrock problem.

The original Rosenbrock function is a challenging optimization problem to solve despite its small size. The minimum 
lies in a banana shaped valley that is easy to find for most methods but difficult to traverse through.

The multidimensional variant presents an additional challenge because the numerical magnitude of the sensitivity terms 
rapidly scale up with the size of the problem and lead to ill-conditioning in the Hessian. This property causes the 
convergence of second-order methods to a-typically degrade at particularly large problem sizes.

Similar pathologies present themselves often in practical applications. In many cases, simply adding second-order 
information does not result in improved ''time-to-solution''. Even though second-order algorithms such as truncated 
Newton methods may converge to the specified tolerance in fewer iterations, each iteration may take significantly 
more time than first-order methods due to the expensive assembly and/or inversion of a Hessian matrix.

The hands-on activities above are intended to reveal these interactions and trade-offs between problem size, 
algorithm choice, application-specific pathologies, and parallelization.

Introducing the bound constraints $$p_1 \leq 0$$ and $$p_2 \geq 0$$ forces the solution to a new global minimum at 
$$f(0,0) = 1.0$$. This minimum is a trivial solution where the bounds for both optimization variables.
are active.

<summary><h4 style="margin: 0 0 0 0; display: inline">Notes on Equality Constraints (Click to expand!)</h4></summary>
The quadratic equality constraint $$(p_1 - 1)^2 + p_2 - 3 = 0$$ presents two local minima instead 
of the original global minimum. These two minima lie at $$f(1.62, 2.62)=0.38$$ and $$f(-0.62, 0.38)=2.62$$. On 
multi-modal problems such as this, gradient-based optimization methods converge to the local minimum closest to the 
starting point. In this hands-on example, we start our solution with an initial guess of $$(10,10)$$ and converge to 
$$f(1.62, 2.62)=0.38$$. A solution that starts at $$(-1,-1)$$ converges to $$f(-0.62, 0.38)=2.62$$ instead.

Combining the equality and bound constraints eliminates one of the two local minima and forces the solution to always 
converge to the now-global minimum at $$f(-0.62, 0.38)=2.62$$ regardless of the starting point.

## Take-Away Messages

* PETSc/TAO offers parallel optimization algorithms for large-scale problems.
* Applications should provide efficient gradient evaluations for best results (e.g., algorithmic differentiation).
* Second-order optimization methods don't always achieve faster/better solutions. Sometimes "less is more".
* When applications provide only function evaluations, PETSc/TAO can automatically compute gradients with finite differencing.
* PETSc/TAO can also use finite differencing to validate application-provided gradients and Hessians.
* Different types of constraints imposed on the problem can change the solution, introduce new local minima, or eliminate existing local minima.
* PETSc/TAO implements methods that can solve problems with both bound, equality and inequality constraints.
